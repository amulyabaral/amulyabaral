Hey there!
I am a second-year student of Master's in Biotechnology at INN, Norway. Although most things in the broader biotech field interest me, I do have to admit that I am particularly hooked to Omics, Microbiology and Molecular Biology. I’m currently learning Metagenomics and programming in Python 🐍 and R. 📫 Send me an e-mail at amulyabaral2@gmail.com !
