Hi, Iâ€™m @amulyabaral! I in my 2nd year of MSc Biotechnology at INN, Norway. Although most things in the broader biotech field interest me, I do have to admit that I am particularly hooked to molecular biology, Antimicrobial Resistance and Omics. Iâ€™m currently learning metagenomics and programming in Python and R. ðŸ“« Send me an e-mail at amulyabaral2@gmail.com !
