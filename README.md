Hey there!

I am a PhD candidate at NMBU, Norway. I'm deeply fascinated by most things biotech, and within it, a little more by antimicrobial resistance. My work has primarily been in metagenomics - essentially exploring the the broad spectrum (pun intended) of antimicrobial resistance's widespread prevalence. ðŸ“« Send me an e-mail at amulyabaral2@gmail.com if you'd like to connect!
